# Crop_Weed_detection
In this project we are going to use YOLOV4 object detection model to detect weeds in crops images.

**Problem statement**
Weeds compete with the host plants. They take up nutients which the crop plants require for their good growth. 
The space and light which the crop plants need is also reduced due to the weeds. 
Therefore, weeds should be removed during the early stages of crops for better growth of the crop plants.

**Dataset:**
I took this dataset from kaggle --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/weedcrop-image-dataset
